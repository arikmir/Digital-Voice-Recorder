# Digital-Voice-Recorder
Application implemented using C programming language on IDE Atmel Studio 7.0 for operating the micro-controller.

**Project by ARIK INTENAM MIR, for CAB301 - QUT**
- **Codes are in C**. 
- **Report Included**


 **Project Summary**
 
 The entire project consists of both hardware and firmware aspects. The hardware aspect of the
project was implemented on the provided breadboard, which consisted of microphone, microphone
amplification circuitry and a 4th order Chebyshev filter for functionality of anti-aliasing. The
software side of things were produced using C programming language on IDE Atmel Studio 7.0
for operating the micro-controller.

And the list of components - 
- LMC6484 multi rail operational amplifier
- TeensyBOBv2 with embedded ATmega32U4 micro-controller
- Development board/ breadboard
- Electric microphone
- Headphone interface kit

Also, equipment such as oscilloscopes and signal generators, and software tools such as LTspice
and MATLAB were thoroughly used to conduct the project to an optimum standard.
